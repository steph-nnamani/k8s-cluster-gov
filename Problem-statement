KUBERNETES CLUSTER GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES
========================================
The Admission Controller is traditionally meant to solve the problem of effective and efficient Kubernetes Cluster Governance. It is still an effective tool. 
However, the problem with Admission Control is that it requires a superior skillset - Golang. Kubernetes Cluster Governance is supposed to be one of the
main duties of DevOps Engineers, but not too many of them can carry out this duty effectively due to defficiency in Golang skill. Even those that are very 
good in Golang spends reasonable time of their hours writting and updating Admission Policies. Why? No.1. It takes time to write No.2. There have been continuous 
rise in the number of microservices deployment across so many organisations, necessitation spike in the number of deployments and increasing focus on ensuring 
that effective cluster governance is always in place. Rules keep changing in response to changing application deployment requirements. 

As a result of the foregoing, any tool that will automate and improve on the compliance enforcement will no doubt reduce the amount of time usually allocated to this 
important aspect of cluster security and ultimately leads to cost savings. This will definitely improve the overall team velocity and efficiency, as Engineers will 
have more time to focus on other areas of productivity. We recently tried a tool that proved to make a huge difference - Kyverno.
